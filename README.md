# unknown
The unknown class  recognition applied in scene reconstruction(my scene repository), we offer a test example to testify our method. The code will be further updated.
 T1 branch: data.pkl and version should be put under model_final.pth(file) for unknown class detection and visualization
The data in T1 would be available in https://pan.baidu.com/s/1EegJf5erloE_Okh8CvlQdw?pwd=4knp and  https://pan.baidu.com/s/1_9P3kdpdFM_qssOFc3barA?pwd=7z2e .
The two links cover known and unknown training results, replace the model.pth in detection-visulization.py
